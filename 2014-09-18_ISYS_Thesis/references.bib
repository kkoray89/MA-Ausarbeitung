  abstract = {We introduce flat systems, which are equivalent to linear ones via
	a special type of feedback called endogenous. Their physical properties
	are subsumed by a linearizing output and they might be regarded as
	providing another nonlinear extension of Kalman's controllability.
	The distance to flatness is measured by a non-negative integer, the
	defect. We utilize differential algebra where flatness- and defect
	are best defined without distinguishing between input, state, output
	and other variables. Many realistic classes of examples are flat.
	We treat two popular ones: the crane and the car with <i>n</i> trailers,
	the motion planning of which is obtained via elementary properties
	of plane curves. The three non-flat examples, the simple, double
	and variable length pendulums, are borrowed from non-linear physics.
	A high frequency control strategy is proposed such that the averaged
	systems become flat.},
