% language = {english, german} 
%            Set default language of document. The class file isys.cls loads the babel
%              package with both options [english, ngerman]. For text that shall be 
%              typeset in a different language than the default language, the 
%              environment 'otherlanguage' or the command '\foreignlanguage' may be used
%              with either of these options (see babel package documentation)
%
% paper    = {a4, letter} - paper size
%
% thesisdraft - mark document as draft without passing "draft" option to 
%                 other packages (e.g. pictures are shown in the document, etc.)
%
% oneside - this option avoids empty pages in the document output 
%                which are necessary for twoside printing, which is useful for 
%                draft versions. 
%                DO NOT USE THIS OPTION WHEN SUBMITTING YOUR THESIS!
